A writing assistant that uses AI to help you communicate with people respectfully using a diverse and inclusive language

== Description ==

Inlexa is a writing assistant that analyzes the text you write in Gutenberg and suggests alternatives to make it more diverse and inclusive. Offered as an online service, it processes the content of your site in our cloud and runs an inclusivity analysis to determine how to improve your copy. You can read our [Privacy Policy](https://inlexa.es/politica-de-privacidad-cookies/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=inlexa) and our [Terms and Conditions](https://inlexa.es/terminos-condiciones-inlexa/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=inlexa) (both in Spanish) to better understand how Inlexa works.
